                <h2>Artifact: SDLC Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    This artifact describes the Iterative & Incremental SDLC model used in the project and explains how
                    each phase interacts and depends on the others.

                <h2>Methodology: Iterative and Incremental</h2>
                <p>
                    We selected an Iterative & Incremental SDLC due to the medical domain's need for frequent feedback and
                    rapid validation with clinicians. Iterations allowed small, testable increments that reduced risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iterative cycles enabled earlier detection of UI and performance issues, and supported continuous
                    refinement of requirements.

                <h2>SDLC Phases and Dependencies</h2>
                <p>
                    The project cycled through planning, analysis & design, implementation, and testing.
                    Phase dependencies were visible: design decisions affected implementation; testing exposed
                    unclear requirements and forced planning revisions.

                <p>
                    The SDLC is a framework for organizing collaboration, quality, and risk management. Iterative development
                    reduced late defects and improved our ability to manage software's inherent invisibility and unpredictability.
