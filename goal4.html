                <h2>Artifact: Methodology Comparison & Quality Framework</h2>
                <p>
                    This artifact compares Waterfall, Agile, and Spiral models and applies quality standards such as
                    ISO 25010 and Definition of Done (DoD) to evaluate their suitability for a medical support application.

                <h2>Comparison of Major Methodologies</h2>

                <div class="phase-item">
                    <h3>Waterfall</h3>
                    <p>
                        A sequential model suitable when requirements are stable. It emphasizes documentation and control
                        but has low adaptability to change.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="phase-item">
                    <h3>Agile / Scrum</h3>
                    <p>
                        Iterative cycles with frequent feedback. Agile handles changing requirements well and supports
                        regular validation with stakeholders.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="phase-item">
                    <h3>Spiral</h3>
                    <p>
                        Risk-driven and iterative. Spiral focuses on identifying and mitigating risks early, making it
                        suitable for high-uncertainty or high-risk projects.
                    </p>

                <h2>Application to the Medical Support Project</h2>
                <p>
                    We adopted an Iterative & Incremental model because clinician feedback and UI performance requirements
                    demanded continuous validation. ISO 25010 quality attributes (reliability, usability, performance)
                    guided measurable acceptance criteria, and the DoD enforced consistent quality.

                    <h3>ISO 25010 Attributes Prioritized</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliability — correct, consistent alerts</li>
                        <li>Performance efficiency — UI latency &lt; 100 ms</li>
                        <li>Usability — clear visual and audio alerts</li>
                        <li>Maintainability — modular GUI and logic separation</li>

                    <p>
                        Each feature required unit tests, style compliance, integration verification, and stakeholder
                        acceptance before being marked done.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Methodology choice must consider project risk, requirement stability, and quality goals. For our
                    medical context, iterative practices combined with strict quality metrics ensured safer and more
                    reliable outcomes.
