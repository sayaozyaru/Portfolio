                <p>
                    This artifact compares Software Engineering (SE) and Computer Science (CS) by using the
                    3P model (People–Process–Product) and the SDLC framework taught in the course.

                <h2>Foundations: What CS and SE Study</h2>

                <div class="phase-item">
                    <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>
                        CS focuses on theoretical foundations of computation: algorithms, data structures,
                        complexity theory, automata, and computational limits. The goal is to understand
                        what is computable and how efficiently.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="phase-item">
                    <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        SE extends beyond computation theory into processes, quality, cost estimation,
                        project planning, risk control, human factors, and lifecycle management.
                        Its objective is to build software that is predictable, safe, and maintainable.

                <h2>Why Software Engineering is a Disciplined Field</h2>

                <div class="challenge-section">
                    <h3>Repeatability & Standards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Engineering discipline requires predictability. SE achieves this through structured
                        models including SDLC (Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral), CMMI maturity levels,
                        ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards, and process frameworks such as PSP/TSP.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge-section">
                    <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        SE deals with real-world constraints: deadlines, budgets, team communication, and user safety.
                        Thus SE systematically manages changing requirements, dependencies, technical debt,
                        and reliability/availability concerns.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge-section">
                    <h3>Focus on Quality Attributes</h3>
                    <p>
                        ISO 25010 defines quality attributes such as reliability, maintainability, security,
                        and usability. SE ensures these attributes through structured verification and validation.
                    </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that SE is defined not by coding skills alone but by systematic methods that ensure
                    predictable quality and project success. Failures in my project (unstable requirements,
                    late discovered defects) illustrated that algorithms alone do not resolve these issues —
                    engineering processes do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This understanding guided my work in Learning Goals 2–5 and influenced decisions such as
                    adopting iterative delivery and formalizing quality checks.
