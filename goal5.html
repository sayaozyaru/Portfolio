                <p>
                    This artifact presents analysis using PSP Lite and proposes team-level improvements aligned with TSP
                    and CMMI concepts.

                <p>
                    PSP Lite was applied to quantify estimation accuracy and identify root causes of rework.

                <p>
                    Integration failures revealed the need for better team coordination and documented interfaces. Proposed
                    improvements include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly Replenishment Meetings (TSP-inspired)</li>
                    <li>Shared, version-controlled interface specifications</li>
                    <li>Process documentation to support CMMI Level 2 maturity</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    The PSP analysis showed how individual estimation and team processes interact. By adding research spikes,
                    enforcing DoD, and adopting TSP practices, the team improved predictability and began moving toward a
                    managed process level (CMMI Level 2). Continued documentation and reuse of process assets will help
                    advance maturity further.
