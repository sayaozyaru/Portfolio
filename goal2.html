                <h2>Artifact: Challenge Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    This artifact analyzes two major challenges encountered during the Brain Tumor Detection
                    Support Application development: <strong>Scope Creep (Technical Debt)</strong> and
                    <strong>Inter-team Dependency Failure</strong>. The analysis maps these issues to course concepts
                    such as the Essence kernel (alphas) and ISO 25010 quality attributes.

                <h2>Challenge 1: Scope Creep (Technical Debt)</h2>
                <p>
                    I expanded the feature set before stabilizing the basic sound alert logic. This premature expansion
                    caused technical debt—time-consuming fixes and unstable behaviour later in development. This is
                    indicative of process immaturity (CMMI Level 1 characteristics).

                    <h3>Solution: Definition of Done (DoD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        To prevent scope creep, I introduced a Definition of Done (DoD) with acceptance criteria:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unit tests for alert logic passed</li>
                        <li>Code follows style and maintainability guidelines</li>
                        <li>Integration test with live data stream succeeded</li>
                        <li>ISO 25010 check: UI response time under 100 ms</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Challenge 2: Inter-Team Dependency Failure</h2>
                <p>
                    During integration, the Data Science team changed the output format without prior coordination.
                    The GUI could not process the stream, highlighting poor dependency management and weak way-of-working.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    The main lesson is that many project failures originate in process and communication gaps rather than purely technical faults.
                    By applying DoD, ISO 25010, and TSP-aligned practices, we improved predictability and reduced defect propagation.
